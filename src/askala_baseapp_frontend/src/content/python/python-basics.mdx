# Python Basics

Welcome to Python programming! Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

## What is Python?

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

### Key Features:
- **Simple and Easy to Learn**: Clean syntax that emphasizes readability
- **Interpreted**: No need to compile before running
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Large Standard Library**: Batteries included philosophy

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Python is dynamically typed.

### Basic Data Types

```python
# Strings
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, World!'

# Numbers
age = 25
height = 5.9
temperature = -10

# Booleans
is_student = True
is_working = False

# None type
result = None
```

### Variable Naming Rules

1. Must start with a letter or underscore
2. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
3. Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)
4. Cannot use Python keywords

```python
# Good variable names
user_name = "john_doe"
total_score = 100
is_valid = True

# Bad variable names (avoid these)
# 2name = "invalid"  # Starts with number
# class = "Python"   # Uses keyword
```

## Basic Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

```python
# Basic arithmetic
a = 10
b = 3

addition = a + b        # 13
subtraction = a - b     # 7
multiplication = a * b  # 30
division = a / b        # 3.333...
floor_division = a // b # 3
modulus = a % b         # 1
exponentiation = a ** b # 1000
```

### String Operations

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

# String concatenation
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe

# String formatting (f-strings - Python 3.6+)
age = 25
message = f"My name is {full_name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)

# String methods
text = "Hello, World!"
print(text.upper())      # HELLO, WORLD!
print(text.lower())      # hello, world!
print(text.replace("World", "Python"))  # Hello, Python!
```

## Input and Output

### Getting User Input

```python
# Getting input from user
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Converting input to numbers
age_number = int(age)
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age_number} years old!")
```

### Printing Output

```python
# Basic print
print("Hello, World!")

# Print multiple values
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

# Print with separator
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=", ")

# Print without newline
print("Loading", end="")
print("...", end="")
print("Done!")
```

## Practice Exercises

Try these exercises to practice what you've learned:

1. **Personal Information**: Create variables for your name, age, and favorite color, then print them in a formatted message.

2. **Calculator**: Write a simple calculator that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Temperature Converter**: Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32

```python
# Exercise 1 Solution
name = "Your Name"
age = 25
favorite_color = "blue"
print(f"Hi, I'm {name}, I'm {age} years old, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

# Exercise 2 Solution
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Sum: {num1 + num2}")
print(f"Difference: {num1 - num2}")
print(f"Product: {num1 * num2}")
if num2 != 0:
    print(f"Division: {num1 / num2}")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand Python basics, you're ready to move on to:
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming

Keep practicing and experimenting with the code examples!
